| GET    | `/announcements/all?teacher_username=...`                         | Get all announcements incl. scheduled/expired (teachers only)       |
| POST   | `/announcements?teacher_username=...`                             | Create an announcement (teachers only)                              |
| PUT    | `/announcements/{id}?teacher_username=...`                        | Update an announcement (teachers only)                              |

Announcement request body: `{ "message": str (1-500 chars), "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD" | null, "expiration_date": "YYYY-MM-DD" }`. An announcement is active when `start_date` (if set) <= today <= `expiration_date`.

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.
